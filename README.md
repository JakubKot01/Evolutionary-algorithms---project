# Evolutionary-algorithms---project

The project was written as a final project for evolutionary algorithms course at the University of Wroclaw.

Basing on original picture, the program uses classical evolutionary strategies to generate the image as similar as possible to the original one
using a limited number of circles, modifying its' parameters:
- color
- position
- size
- transparency

Example of program result - reconstruction of the Mona Lisa:
